  PokebowlDex
</h1>

Aren‚Äôt you tired of wondering what your favorite gluttonous Pok√©mon like to eat? Me too! That‚Äôs why PokebowlDex is here to help.

Born out of a love for food and the mons (that‚Äôs what the cool kids call them these days... right?), PokebowlDex showcases some of the biggest, hungriest, and most delicious-looking Pok√©mon out there ‚Äî along with their favorite dishes.

It‚Äôs tailor-made for those Pok√©mon trainers who have to catch ‚Äôem all‚Ä¶ but only after dinner.
## Features
- Single-page application using Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS for styling
- Two screens: Pok√©dex list view (/) & Detail view (/pokemon/[name])
- Shows Pok√©mon from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/), no API key needed
- Detail view attributes and a custom ‚Äúfavorite dish‚Äù field I personally added based on years of field research
- Pagination of items
- Unit tests written with Jest/React Testing Library
- Responsive design
- Passed Lighthouse audit (it's not much but its honest work üë®‚Äçüåæ)

## With More Time & Snacks...

While the core goals of the project were completed with roughly 12 hours of focused work, here are a few areas I‚Äôd explore or refine further with more time:

- **Enhanced Accessibility:**  
  Improve ARIA roles, keyboard focus states, and add screen reader labels to interactive elements.

- **Unit & Integration Test Coverage:**  
  Expand tests to cover edge cases, navigation flows, and possible error states with more detail.

- **UX/UI:**  
  Take a Designer course. Then go to Designer school. Followed by an apprenticeship at Apple. And then maybe have the skill to improve UI
